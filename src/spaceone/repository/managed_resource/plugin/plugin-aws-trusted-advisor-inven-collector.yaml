    to users to provision resources according to AWS best practices. It scans your
    AWS environment and provides advice to improve system performance, security, and
    cost management, ultimately helping you optimize your AWS infrastructure. This
    plugin collects best practices information and recommendations through the Trusted
    Advisor API. The Trusted Advisor API is only supported on the AWS Business plan
    and above.
